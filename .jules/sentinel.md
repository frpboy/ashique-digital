## 2026-10-28 - Missing Rate Limiting on Public Newsletter Endpoint
**Vulnerability:** The `/api/newsletter` route allowed unrestricted POST requests to trigger outgoing transactional emails via Resend without rate limiting, exposing the system to email bombing, API quota exhaustion, and spam abuse.
**Learning:** Public intake routes (`/api/contact`, `/api/free-audit`) implemented Upstash-backed rate limiting via `@/lib/ratelimit`, but `/api/newsletter` was missed during the initial endpoint rollout.
**Prevention:** Ensure any public API endpoint that triggers external side-effects (such as email delivery via Resend or mutations) extracts client IP via `x-forwarded-for` and enforces Upstash rate limiting before performing external API calls.
